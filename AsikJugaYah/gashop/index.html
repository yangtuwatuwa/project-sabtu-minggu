    TENTANG TOKO KAMI

<p>
    part of intercity trains across the central Java Island along with commuters connecting the southern and northern regions of Greater Jakarta such as South Jakarta, North Jakarta, Depok City, Bogor Regency and City, West Java.

This station is also known as Beos Station or Kota Station, although the original name of this station is Batavia-benedenstad Station and since the Japanese occupation era, began to use the name Djakarta (Jakarta Station originally refers to this station). The name "Kota Station" can also refer to Surabaya Kota Station.

The existence of Jakarta Kota Station is currently debated because it wants to be renovated with the addition of commercial space. Even though this station has been designated as a cultural heritage. In addition to its ancient buildings, this station is the final destination of the trip. As well as Surabaya Kota Station or Semut Station in the city of Surabaya, East Java, which is a cultural heritage, but there is also a renovation that is considered controversial.

History
The name Beos in the station's nickname has many versions. First, the name Beos refers to the name of the Batavia BOS Bataviasche Oosterspoorweg Maatschapij (East Batavia Railway Transport Airline), which was at the same location before it was dismantled. [4] The company is a private railway company that connects Batavia with Kedunggedeh. Another version, Beos comes from the word Batavia En Omstreken, which means Batavia and its surroundings, which comes from the function of the station as a railway transportation center that connects Batavia City with other cities such as Bekassie (Bekasi), Buitenzorg (Bogor), Parijs van Java (Bandung), Karavam (Karawang), and others. [5]

Actually, there is still another name for this Jakarta City Station, namely Batavia Zuid which means South Batavia Station. [4] This name came about because by the end of the 19th century, Batavia already had more than two railway stations. One is Batavia Noord Station (North Batavia) which is located south of the current Jakarta History Museum. Batavia Noord was originally owned by the Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij railway company, and was the terminus for the Batavia-Buitenzorg line. In 1913 the Batavia-Buitenzorg line was sold to the Dutch East Indies government and managed by the Staatsspoorwegen. At that time, the Jatinegara and Tanjung Priok areas did not include the Batavia gemeente. [5]

Batavia Zuid, originally built around 1887, was closed in 1926 to be renovated into the current building. During the construction of this station, trains used Batavia Noord station. About 200 m from the closed station was the current Jakarta Kota Station. Its construction was completed on August 19, 1929 and officially put into use on October 8, 1929. The inauguration ceremony was carried out on a large scale with the planting of buffalo heads by the Governor General of jhr. A.C.D. de Graeff who ruled the Dutch East Indies in 1926-1931. [6]

Behind the splendor of this station, the name of a Dutch architect born in Tulungagung, September 8, 1882, is Frans Johan Louwrens Ghijsels. [5] Together with his friends such as Hein von Essen and F. Stolts, the man who completed his architectural education in Delft founded the architecture firm Algemeen Ingenieur Architectenbureau (AIA). The work of this bureau can be seen from the Department of Sea Transportation building in Medan Merdeka Timur and the PELNI Hospital in Petamburan, both in Jakarta and the Panti Rapih Hospital in Yogyakarta.

This station, in the colonial era there were two, namely Batavia NIS (Batavia Noord) and Batavia BOS (Batavia Zuid). [4] After the two stations were purchased by the colonial government, the state railway company, Staatsspoor en Tramwegen, planned to build a new major station on the site of the Batavia BOS Station, which had been closed since 1923. Instead, the Batavia Noord ex-NIS station which is 200 meters to the North as the main station to serve passengers. In 1926, the ex-BOS station began to be dismantled. This construction was a project of the construction of a state-owned station building, so the Burgerlijke Openbare Werken, (Department of Public Works of the Dutch East Indies), was involved in its construction.

Beos Station is a masterpiece of Ghijsels known as Het Indische Bouwen, which is a combination of modern western structures and techniques combined with traditional local forms. With a thick art deco wrap, Ghijsels' design seems simple even though it has a high taste. In keeping with the philosophy of Ancient Greece, simplicity is the shortest path to beautypart of intercity trains across the central Java Island along with commuters connecting the southern and northern regions of Greater Jakarta such as South Jakarta, North Jakarta, Depok City, Bogor Regency and City, West Java.
